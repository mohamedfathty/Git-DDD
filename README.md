# **Drowsiness Detection System**

This project implements a drowsiness detection system using computer vision and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system is designed to detect driver drowsiness and provide real-time alerts in a car environment. The key components include:

Computer Vision: Utilizes a camera to monitor the driver’s face, detecting signs of drowsiness through eye blink detection and head position analysis using machine learning models.

ESP32 Microcontroller: Sends real-time alerts to the car’s control system, activating safety mechanisms such as alarms or speed reduction.

Visualization: Alerts are visualized via a dashboard in the car, providing clear indicators an audio and a visaul alerts of drowsiness to both the driver and passengers.

This system aims to improve road safety by reducing the risks of accidents caused by drowsy driving. It’s an efficient, affordable, and scalable solution for real-time monitoring in vehicles.
